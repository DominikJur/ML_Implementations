# Homemade Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to the **Homemade Machine Learning Algorithms** repository! This repository contains my personal implementations of various machine learning algorithms as part of my journey as an applied mathematics student. The focus here is on learning, understanding, and applying fundamental concepts of machine learning by building algorithms from scratch, rather than relying on libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.

## About the Project

As an applied mathematics student, I am fascinated by the interplay between math and machine learning. This repository is a collection of classical machine learning algorithms I have implemented from scratch in Python. The goal is to deepen my understanding of the mathematical foundations behind these algorithms while developing programming skills.

These implementations do not aim to be highly optimized or production-ready; rather, they are educational in nature, focused on readability, clarity, and correctness.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus and Gradient-Based Optimization
- Probability Theory and Statistics
- Numerical Methods

## Implemented Algorithms

Here is a list of machine learning algorithms currently implemented in this repository:

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Gradient Descent
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classification algorithm based on proximity

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (for visualizations)
  - `scipy` (for certain numerical methods)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
